This file lists a couple of items that need drastic improvement or general code cleanup.

1. nectar_loader: split parser and lexer

2. algorithm: generalize a split_string, it is used in commandline and parse_binary for sure, maybe other places as well.

3. clean up file_cache, and don't try to match every file if there are no wildcards.
