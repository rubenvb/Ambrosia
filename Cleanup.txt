This file lists a couple of items that need drastic improvement or general
code cleanup.

1. ambrosia::error class
    This seemed the best way to handle internal library errors, and to be able
    to abstract away return codes up to the level of Ambrosia's application
    states. Apart from the ugly syntax, it works quite well except in:
     - begin::event(), in case 0, where a lot of checks need to be made because
     this is the only place where an end_state can be returned.

2. target and node
    dependency_list is copied to node, when it is completely unnecessary to
    have this info in two seperate places.
