This is a description of the Ambrosia codestyle adopted in all source files
in the project.

0. Don't abbreviate. Use full words.
1. identifier names: use STL-style naming, meaning lower-case and underscores
    between words.
2. Function arguments:
    built-in types (maximum size: ~8 bytes): by value
    anything else: (const) reference
3. Define all functions/code in a source file, no inline definitions.
4. Variable prefixes:
    ALL (smart) pointers: p_*
    static (member) variables: s_*
    member variables: m_*
    local variables: no prefix
5. Getters and setters: setters use a name beginning with 'set_' or 'add_' or
    something relevant. Getters use the variable name, without the 'm_' prefix.
    The argument name in  the setter is also the name of the getter. Getters
    return a const reference to the member where applicable.
    Example:
    class B;
    class A
    {
    public:
        A( const int member, const B& b ) : m_member(member), m_b(b) {}

        const B& b() const;
        const int& member() const;
        void set_member( const int member );
        void set_b( const B& b );

    private:
        int m_member
        B m_b;
    }
6. Includes and namespaces:
    - never use a using statement in a header.
    - always use using <namespace>::typename statements under the relevant header include line.
    - include only the necessary headers. Avoid double includes, also if they're not evident.
       Example:
       class.h
       #include <string>
       #include <vector>
       class.cpp
       /* <string> */
           using std::string;
       /* <vector> */
           using std::vector;
