This is a description of the Ambrosia codestyle adopted in all source files
in the project.

0. Don't abbreviate. Use full words.
1. identifier names: snake_case
2. Function arguments:
    built-in types (maximum size: ~8 bytes): by value
    anything else: (const) reference
6. Includes and namespaces:
    - never use a using statement in a header.
    - always use using <namespace>::typename statements under the relevant header include line.
    - include only the necessary headers.
       Example:
       /* class.h */
       #include <string>
       #include <vector>
       /* class.cpp */
       #include <string>
         using std::string;
       #include <vector>
         using std::vector;
