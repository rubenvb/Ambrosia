These are aspects of Ambrosia operation that need to be sufficiently tested and verified as functional
before they can be classified as "feature" or, in the case of correct error reporting, correct.

1. Error reporting

   1) Project file location
       - file specified on commandline
       - directory or nothing specified on commandline
         -> no project file found
         -> multiple project files found
   2) Malformed project files need to report correct line number and the exact problem
       - Testcases should be added as people report problems, it is undoable to test each possible case.

2. Unicode support

   1) Project file encoding is UTF8
   2) Project directories may contain any unicode character
       - important that file_exists and directory_exists works for unicode paths
