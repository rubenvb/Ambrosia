TODO marks all sections of code with a known limitation. These are not bugs, just algorithmic oddities
 or incomplete functionality in the wide sense of the word.

 - Allow project file commandline speccification without extension [.nectar].txt so that all these would work:
    Ambrosia ../source/ambrosia.nectar.txt
    Ambrosia ../source/ambrosia.nectar
    Ambrosia ../source/ambrosia
- Error reporting at syntax errors needs to do it Clang-wise, and point to the exact place where the problem is at
   these are the classes that need upgrading:
    nectar_loader
    everything in Parser/*
- Improve next_token to allow it to read tokens surrounded by qoutes.
