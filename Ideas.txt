TODO marks all sections of code with a known limitation. These are not bugs, just algorithmic oddities
 or incomplete functionality in the wide sense of the word.

 - Allow project file commandline speccification without extension [.nectar].txt so that all these would work:
    Ambrosia ../source/ambrosia.nectar.txt
    Ambrosia ../source/ambrosia.nectar
    Ambrosia ../source/ambrosia
- Error reporting at syntax errors needs to do it Clang-wise, and point to the exact place where the problem is at
   these are the classes that need upgrading:
    nectar_loader
    everything in Parser/*
- Improve next_token to allow it to read tokens surrounded by qoutes.
- Compiler options:
   GCC/ld can improve final link size in (among others) a static link when they use: -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections and -Wl,--gc-sections.
   MSVC does this using /Gy and link.exe's /OPT:REF
- Improve target::add_directory to read cached file data from somewhere. Only fix if performance sucks.
   This would make it so that scan_directory is only called once per Ambrosia run, instead of once, per occurence.
   Of course the user should work around that by adding the directory in the global target if possible.
