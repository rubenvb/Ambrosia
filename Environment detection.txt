Cross-compilation
=================

Ambrosia supports cross-compilation "natively", which means it was inherently baked into
the program and not an afterthought. There are three terms that are important in cross-
compilation: host, target and build:

Host: the platform/OS where the created binary will run/be used.
Target: Only important when compiling compilers; the host the created binary will create binaries for. Confused?
Build: the platform/OS where Ambrosia is run. This is the easiest to determine (it's compiled in)

Target is not implemented for now (not really a reason to do so). The host option can be altered (see next section).

SUPPORT
-------
This table lists the target OS - toolchain combinations that Ambrosia can build with/for.
The left column is the option provided by the "-cross=..." option on the commandline.

If no "-cross=..." option is passed, auto-detection is initiated:

0. Environment variables CC, CXX, LD, etc. are used.
1. Native compilation is assumed, which means running Ambrosia
   on Windows x64 will by default create Win64 binaries if possible.
2. Toolchain ordering:
   1) GCC
   2) (Windows only) MSVC
   3) Clang
   4) Intel

A "-toolchain=..." option will allow to choose a specific one if more of
them are in PATH.

This information is unique to a run of Ambrosia, and can only be altered
by the "-cross=..." or "-toolchain=..." options. Many platform specific
settings (like inclusion of source files or not in a certain target) can be
determined this way by using following builtin conditionals:
Note: most of these config strings can be set on a per-target basis
