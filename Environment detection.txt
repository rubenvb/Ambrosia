Cross-compilation
=================

Ambrosia supports cross-compilation "natively", which means it was inherently baked into
the program and not an afterthought. There are three terms that are important in cross-
compilation: host, target and build:

Host: the platform/OS where the created binary will run/be used.
Target: Only important when compiling compilers; the host the created binary will create binaries for. Confused?
Build: the platform/OS where Ambrosia is run. This is the easiest to determine (it's compiled in)

Target is not implemented for now (not really a reason to do so). The host option can be altered (see next section).

SUPPORT
-------
This table lists the target OS - toolchain combinations that Ambrosia can build with/for.
The left column is the option provided by the "-cross=..." option on the commandline.

If no "-cross=..." option is passed, auto-detection is initiated:

1. Native compilation is assumed, which means running Ambrosia
   on Windows x64 will by default create Win64 binaries if possible.
2. Toolchain ordering:
   1) GCC
   2) (Windows only) MSVC
   3) Clang
   4) Intel

This information is unique to a run of Ambrosia, and can only be altered by the "-cross=..." option.
Many platform specific settings (like inclusion of source files or not in a certain target) can be
determined this way by using conditionals
